  <h1>Editing navigation</h1>

  <p>
    When adding new pages to your documentation, you'll need to link them
    at some place in the navigation menu.
  </p>

  <p>
    By default, the left-hand-side navigation of your documentation site
    is defined in the <code>src/navigation.json</code> file. Currently, only
    two-level navigation is supported.
  </p>

  <p>
    The navigation JSON file groups pages (articles) in your site into chapters:
  </p>

  <pre data-language="json">{
  "chapters": [
    {
      "title": "Getting started",
      "articles": [
        "getting-started",
        "quick-start"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Basic usage",
      "articles": [
        "editing-navigation",
        "editing-pages",
        "code-blocks",
        "customization"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Advanced topics",
      "articles": [
        "under-the-hood",
        "configuration-reference"
      ]
    }
  ]
}</pre>

  <p>
    The <code>articles</code> array lists identifiers of pages to link to the
    specific chapter. An identifier of <code>getting-started</code>, for example,
    will be mapped to <code>content/getting-started.html</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that a page will not appear in the menu until you create
    its corresponding HTML file. A warning will be logged to DevTools console.
