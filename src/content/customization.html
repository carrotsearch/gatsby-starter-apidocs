  <h1>Customization</h1>

  <p>
    APIdocs was created for documenting our software products at Carrot Search,
    so its customization options are limited. You can still customize the basic
    things like site logo, footer and add your own CSS.
  </p>

  <section id="logo">
    <h2>Site logo</h2>

    <p>
      Site logo is by default read from <code>src/logo.html</code>. Contents
      of this file will be inserted in the site's logo place holder in the
      upper left corner of the page. The file must contain valid HTML, there
      can be one or more tags on the first level, you can also use SVG.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can style your logo either by inline CSS styles in
      <code>src/logo.html</code> or by editing <code>src/styles/custom.css</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In development mode, all changes to the logo HTML will be applied
      in real time to the site preview.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="footer">
    <h2>Site footer</h2>

    <p>
      Site footer is by default read from <code>src/footer.html</code>. Contents
      of the file will be appended below the main article. The file must contain
      valid HTML. Ideally, the footer should be contained in a single <code>footer</code>
      tag, though multiple root-level elements are allowed too. You can use
      SVG, if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will most likely style place styles for your footer in
      <code>src/styles/custom.css</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In development mode, all changes to the footer HTML will be applied
      in real time to the site preview.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="custom-css">
    <h2>Custom CSS</h2>

    <p>
      You can place extra CSS styles in <code>src/styles/custom.css</code>. You
      can use that file to style logo and footer as well as tweak the appearance
      of the whole site.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CSS file will be processed by Webpack running inside Gatsby, so
      you can use all Webpack magic, like importing webfonts directly from
      npm dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In development mode, all changes to the custom CSS will be applied
      in real time to the site preview.
